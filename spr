<p>Dear Andromo Member,</p>
<p>Seven years ago, during the deep dark Canadian winter, we set out to change the way that people create apps [<a href="https://blog.andromo.com/2011/brief-history-of-app-crunchiness/">A Brief History of App Crunchiness</a>]. We wanted to democratize the app making process. Make it possible for anyone to create apps, even if they’d never coded a day in their life.</p>
<p>Since then, over 750,000 people have signed up on Andromo.com. Together you have built 700,000 projects, performed 1.3 million app builds, and achieved hundreds of millions of installs. Your apps have seen billions and billions of user sessions. Not too shabby for people who “don’t know how to code,” wouldn’t you say?</p>
<p><em>Today we take the next step.</em></p>
<p><strong>Indigo Rose Software is excited to announce that <a href="https://www.andromo.com">Andromo App Maker</a> has been acquired by a private investment group and reorganized under the new company Andromo BV.</strong> Based in the Netherlands, Andromo BV brings more financial resources, experience, people and ideas to the table. They are well positioned to strengthen and enhance what everyone knows and loves about Andromo.</p>
<p>Andromo’s mission is still the same: Help people make apps without coding. Give them the tools to start their own app business and never look back. However, there will now be more resources available to improve and expand Andromo. To introduce new services. To make things better, easier and more profitable for app developers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Customers can expect the switch to be seamless: all projects, apps, logins and customer details will carry over. Any paid subscription time and details will be transferred to and honored by Andromo BV.</span></strong> Customers are their top priority.</p>
<blockquote><p>Niels Benjamins, newly appointed CEO of Andromo BV, had this to say:</p>
<p>“At Andromo BV we are looking forward to start working with this great platform. We have some awesome plans to make Andromo even more user-friendly and add exciting new features and activities to the platform. Plus, we are going to introduce easier ways to start earning money through the applications you make with Andromo. By giving Andromo the resources and attention it needs, and working closely with all of the content creators who use Andromo (who we see as our partners), we know we can create something truly special together.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to say that none of this would have been possible if not for the amazing rock star programmers here at Indigo Rose (Lorne Laliberte, Darryl Hnatiuk and alumni Mark Mruss), along with all of our loyal customers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Thanks to all of you for helping to make Andromo awesome.</em></span></p>
<p>Here’s to the future! It’s going to be great.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4407" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.andromo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/colin-signature.png?resize=290%2C44&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="290" height="44" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<li>AdMob &#8211; Will only serve non-personalized ads for EU users.</li>
<li>StartApp &#8211; Will only serve non-personalized ads for EU users.</li>
<li>AppLovin &#8211; Will only serve non-personalized ads for EU users.</li>
<li>Others &#8211; Disabled the following ad networks for EU users: Amazon, AppBrain, Facebook Audience Network.</li>
<li>Analytics &#8211; Disabled Andromo &amp; Google analytics for EU users.</li>
<li>AirBop &#8211; Disabled AirBop for EU users.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Requirements for AdMob, StartApp or AppLovin Ads</strong></h3>
<p>If your app includes AdMob, StartApp or AppLovin ads, you must perform the following steps to be compliant:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable the &#8220;Launch Notice&#8221; dialog in your app for EU users. To do this, go to your project&#8217;s &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab, enable the &#8220;Show Launch Notice&#8221; checkbox and then enable the &#8220;European Union countries only (uncheck for Worldwide)&#8221; checkbox. The text you provide is up to you, however below is an example of what might be appropriate for your app if you include AdMob:<br />
<blockquote><p>We care about your privacy and data security. We keep this app free by showing ads. We&#8217;ll partner with Google and use a unique identifier on your device to serve only non-personalized ads.<br />
For information about how Google uses your mobile identifier please visit:<br />
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</p></blockquote>
<p>You should inform users about these ad networks in your Launch Notice text, including links to their privacy policies.</p>
<p>The privacy policies for StartApp and AppLovin can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.applovin.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.applovin.com/privacy</a><br />
<a href="http://www.startapp.com/policy/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.startapp.com/policy/privacy-policy/</a></p>
<p>Google&#8217;s policy page can be found at:<br />
<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></li>
<li>Once you&#8217;ve made the above changes, increase your app&#8217;s version number on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab, and then generate a new build of your app by clicking the &#8220;Build My App&#8221; button on your project&#8217;s &#8220;Build&#8221; tab. Once the build has completed, test it and publish the new version to all of the app stores you previously published to.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Requirements for All Apps</strong></h4>
<p>Even if your app does not contain ads, you&#8217;ll need to generate a new build of your app to comply with GDPR. This is also a good time to revisit adding a &#8220;cookie notice&#8221;. Refer to our KB article &#8220;<a href="http://support.andromo.com/kb/common-questions/eu-user-consent-privacy-policy">EU User Consent / Privacy Policy</a>&#8221; for more info &#8211; or read up at <a href="https://www.cookiechoices.org/">https://www.cookiechoices.org/</a>.</p>
<p>To generate a new build, increase your app&#8217;s version number on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab, and then go to your project&#8217;s &#8220;Build&#8221; tab and click the &#8220;Build My App&#8221; button. Once the build has completed, test it and publish the new version to all of the app stores you previously published to.</p>
<h2>Further Details&#8230;</h2>
<h4>What is GDPR?</h4>
<p>The basics of GDPR state that if you are located in the EU or your app is targeting users in the EU, then you need to obtain explicit consent from the user in order to collect and store &#8220;<em>personal information.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The exact language and wording is much more complicated than written above (specifically concerning what exactly is <em>personal information</em>), but that is the gist of it. You can and should read the official document <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en">2018 reform of EU data protection rules</a> or if you can&#8217;t make it through that document, the &#8220;simplified version&#8221; is available from <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">GDPR Portal</a>. It makes excellent bedtime reading.</p>
<h4>Why Should You Care?</h4>
<p>At first glance you might think that your app doesn&#8217;t collect <em>personal information</em> so this does not apply to you. However, the definition of personal information is quite broad and extends to IP addresses and mobile device identifiers &#8211; not just names, addresses and medical records.</p>
<p>The problem lies with the fact that over the years, all advertising networks have evolved to store that information so that they can track and identify users behavior and serve up what has come to be known as &#8220;personalized ads&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, while your app itself may never have asked people for their name, email, address etc., the ad networks and analytics providers are still making use of IP and device identifiers.</p>
<h4>What Does it Require of You?</h4>
<p>In a nutshell, to be compliant with GDPR your app either needs to obtain explicit consent to collect and store personal information, or it needs to stop storing that info for anyone in the EU.</p>
<p>To obtain explicit consent requires a startup screen that asks users to specifically sign up to be tracked and receive &#8220;personalized ads&#8221; from each ad network you work with, along with privacy policy information for each one. For context, Google&#8217;s AdMob has literally thousands of ad providers enabled by default&#8230;</p>
<p>At the moment, the tools and recommendations to deal with explicit consent are simply inadequate to make that realistic.</p>
<h4>What we Have Done for Andromo Apps</h4>
<p>The safest option right now is to disable anything in your app that stores personal information if the user is located in the EU. That is what we have done in Andromo v5.0.15 so that you can put out a GDPR compliant app today.</p>
<p>Fortunately several ad networks supported by Andromo have now added the ability to turn off <em>personalized ads</em> and instead serve up only <em>non personalized ads</em>. Hopefully more will follow suit in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, once the tools and procedures to obtain explicit consent for personalized ads solidify, we can revisit and see about making that an option.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.andromo.com">Andromo App Maker for Android</a> version 5.0.13 has been released.</p>
<p>Here is a list of changes in this version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added some item styles with a new layout behaviour similar to the &#8220;button grid&#8221; dashboard style from Andromo v4 (&#8220;Grid: square image + side title&#8221;, &#8220;Grid: square image + side title auto-color&#8221;, &#8220;Grid: square image + side title subtitle&#8221; and &#8220;Grid: square image + side title subtitle auto-color&#8221;). Note: these styles are automatically adjusted when used with a background image. If a background image exists, the items will be slightly translucent and use a different divider type so the background image remains subtly visible behind the item.</li>
<li>Improved the look of some grid styles when a background image is used.</li>
<li>Improved the quality of images in the Photo Gallery activity when one dimension of the source image is slightly larger than 1024 pixels.</li>
<li>Changed how the audio controls are displayed on right-to-left language devices so they&#8217;re consistent with other audio apps.</li>
<li>Added support for sms: and smsto: in Website, Custom Page, and HTML Archive activities.</li>
<li>Made it so tel: URIs are automatically escaped to preserve special characters such as # for links in Website, Custom Page, and HTML Archive activities.</li>
<li>Added a new &#8220;Add Activity&#8221; dropup button below the Project &gt; Activities list. Reduces the need to scroll up to the top of the page for those people with lots of activities in their projects.</li>
<li>Changed the minimum time between builds of the same project to 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Fixed the account username signup message to read &#8220;Minimum 4 characters&#8221;.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.andromo.com">Andromo App Maker for Android</a> version 5.0.5 has been released.</p>
<p>Here is a list of changes in this version release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a background image option for the Dashboard and the following Activities: Audio Player, Podcast, SHOUTcast Radio. Dr. Andromo aims to please!</li>
<li>Made the audio controls translucent (and other small adjustments) so they look cool when background images are used.</li>
<li>A darkening gradient is automatically applied to the background image when banner ads are enabled, so the background becomes more subtle around the ad. (A 12-step simulated cubic gradient, so it&#8217;s extra smoooooth!)</li>
<li>Added 11 new Dashboard item styles, including List styles with cool bubble text (they look awesome over a background photo), plus a bunch of 3:1 ratio Card styles for those developers who want to fit more cards per screen.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.andromo.com">Andromo App Maker for Android</a> version 5.0.4 has been released.</p>
<p>Here is a list of changes in this version release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with AdMob banners where the returned ad size was larger than the provided ad space resulting in no ad displaying on some sized devices.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Norwegian language translations were not being used correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with several Drawer Icon options that would cause a build failure if chosen.</li>
<li>Added a &#8220;Use legacy icon image&#8221; option to the Square Image dropdown menu for Activities created using Andromo v4.  Moving forward, you should upload higher quality images (Andromo v4 limited you to square 256&#215;256 icon graphic files). Andromo v5 now supports high resolution photo quality 1440&#215;1440 images&#8230; However, for quick project updates, this new feature should save some time migration old projects over to v5!</li>
<li>Added smart migration of projects to Andromo v5. For any project that has not been updated since v5 was released, we have updated your project and set the &#8220;Dashboard item style&#8221; for you, to match up with the closest v5 style that uses Square Images. Then, for any Activity that has not been updated, we have set the &#8220;Square Image&#8221; to be your old legacy icon image. Moving forward we recommend you update your images to new higher quality versions and investigate the 50 new awesome looking <a href="https://blog.andromo.com/2017/new-dashboard-styles-in-andromo-v5/">Material dashboard styles</a> that are now available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Andromo App Maker for Android v5.0.4 is now live at <a href="https://www.andromo.com">www.andromo.com</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.andromo.com">Andromo App Maker for Android</a> version 5.0.3 has been released.</p>
<p>Here is a list of changes in this version release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added interactive screenshots for all Dashboard Item Styles. You&#8217;ll now see an example screenshot of what each dashboard item style looks like as you choose it in your project. Want to see them all at once? See our blog post: <a href="https://blog.andromo.com/2017/new-dashboard-styles-in-andromo-v5/">New Dashboard Styles in Andromo v5</a></li>
<li>For those users who have been uploading invalid/corrupted PNG image files (just renaming a file .png does not make it a .png file folks!), we now detect that as it happens when uploading and building.</li>
<li>Fixed bug with activity position not saving for Radio activities.</li>
<li>Now enforcing SSL for the entire site.</li>
<li>Resolved a build error that occurred when the Dashboard was turned off and you only had a single YouTube activity or a single Website activity with the &#8220;Open in External Browser&#8221; option checked. Activities without a &#8220;view&#8221; can not be either the first activity or the only activity in your app. This fixes that automatically now.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the About dialog would crash on Samsung devices when the Target Market was set to &#8216;Samsung Apps&#8217;.</li>
<li>Made it so the navigation drawer header image uses a 16:9 aspect ratio on any type of device.</li>
<li>Made it so a text scrim is automatically applied to the navigation drawer header image to improve text contrast and legibility unless the title and subtitle are blank.</li>
<li>Added a new Dashboard item style &#8216;Grid: square image + title. 3 columns auto-color&#8217;.</li>
<li>Fixed the translations for the navigation drawer&#8217;s &#8216;Settings&#8217; and &#8216;About&#8217; items.</li>
</ul>
